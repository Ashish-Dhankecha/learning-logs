# Learning Logs — AI / ML Engineering

This repository is a **public execution log** of my journey as an AI / Machine Learning engineer.

The purpose of this repo is simple:
- Practice concepts by **writing real code**
- Build intuition through **experiments and implementations**
- Maintain a transparent, version-controlled record of learning

This is **not** a polished portfolio.
This is a working lab.

## Background (Context Only)

Before starting this repository, I already had working knowledge of:
- Python (core language, OOP, basic data structures)
- PostgreSQL and SQL fundamentals

This repository focuses on **building on top of that foundation**, not learning programming from zero.

## What You’ll Find Here

The repository is organized by learning phases, roughly following the stack required for modern AI systems.
